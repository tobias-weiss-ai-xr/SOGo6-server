# When a non-organizer attendee modifies an event they received, the server compares the submitted

# re-states the whole event (echoing an occurrence's date, or dropping EXDATE) triggers a FALSE
# rejection. The intended usage is a minimal update (only the changed fields), so this flag stays True.
# Set to False to instead silently keep only the attendee's personal fields (reminders, conference
# data) and ignore any organizer-content drift - lenient toward whole-event submissions, but a genuine
# content change by an attendee is then dropped with no feedback. This flag is the server-side safety
